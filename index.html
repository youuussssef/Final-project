            <h3>Fortnite reload</h3>
            <p>Fortnite launched a new mode called Fortnite Reload this weekend that features a new map, a ton of classic weapons and locations, endless respawns as long as one player on the team remains alive, and no vehicles.

                As the Fortnite team explains, Fortnite Reload is a 40-player experience in "full or partial squads" on a "tighter map" with points of interest like Tilted Towers and Retail Row, and players can start the action much faster than in other modes.
                
                
                When a player is downed, their individual countdown begins and continues as long as another team member is alive. Reset timers start at 30 seconds and increase up to 40 seconds later in the match. Teammates can reduce the time before their friends return by taking down an opponent (-2 seconds), eliminating a player (-4 seconds), and eliminating an entire squad (-10 seconds).
                
                While it's nice to see your teammates come back all the time, it's important to note that these resurrections stop towards the end of a match, so make sure you never get too comfortable with your tactics aggressive.
                
                In addition to all of these respawns, a handful of unusual gear has joined the fun in Fortnite Reload, including the Revolver, Tactical Shotgun, Lever Action Shotgun, OG Heavy Shotgun, Tactical Submachine Gun, infantry rifle, heavy assault rifle, bolt-action sniper rifle, rocket launcher and grappling hook.</p>
